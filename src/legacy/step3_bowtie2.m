% This script generates sgRNA counts for a given sample by inexact
% matching. This is done by generating genomic alignment start positions
% for all reads in a given sample. Then these start positions are compared
% to the start positions that we determined for our library of sgRNA
% previously, and if they match, then the read is mapped to the corresponding
% sgRNA.

% While Bowtie itself allows for mismatches while aligning reads to the
% genome, We can also have reads are aligned 1 nt to the left or right of
% the true start position due to sequencing errors. To capture this, we
% allow for some wiggle room in the start position mapping. If the start
% position of a read matches to the start position of an sgRNA to within 1
% nt in either direction, then we map that read to that sgRNA.

% Inputs:
% 1. Examplefile1_Cas9_bam. Obtained as a result of running bowtie on
% 'Examplefile1_Cas9.fastqsanger' against the genome file
% 'CLIB89+control_Cas9.fasta'.
% 2. All_sgRNA_pos_Cas9.mat: variable file containg genomic start positions of
% all Cas9 sgRNA in the library.

% Outputs:
% Bowtie_counts_1.mat: Variable file containing Bowtie counts for a given
% sample.

% *Note*: This script also requires the use of the fast and efficient custom
% 'count_unique' function written by the user Anthony Kendall. This
% function may be downlaoded at:

%% Reading BAM file and storing alignments against all chromosomes

% Inputs are Bam files that are the result of aligning sgRNA from any
% particular sample against the genome using Bowtie. There will again be an
% extra chromosome here as all the nontargeting sgRNA were added as a
% seperate chromosome to allow for the aligment of the entire library.
